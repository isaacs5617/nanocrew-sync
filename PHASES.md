# NanoCrew Sync — Build Phases

> Source of truth for build progress from alpha → paid GA.
> Update checkboxes as phases land. Each phase ends with a commit + tag.

**Legend:** `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked/deferred

---

## Phase 0 — Ship what we have (alpha)

- [x] Tauri 2 desktop shell with React UI
- [x] Argon2id admin account, SQLite drive + credentials store
- [x] WinFsp 2.1 integration — drives mount at Windows letters
- [x] S3 read path — case-insensitive resolution, range GETs
- [x] S3 write path — temp-file spool + streaming 16 MiB multipart with 8-way concurrency
- [x] Rename (including case-only), delete, mkdir
- [x] Transfers screen with live upload progress
- [x] Activity screen (mount/unmount events)
- [x] Settings screen skeleton (most toggles marked "coming soon")
- [x] WinFsp detection + prompt-to-install
- [x] `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (proprietary), `README.md`, `PHASES.md`
- [x] Private GitHub repo + initial push
- [x] Tag `v0.1.0-alpha` (superseded by v0.1.1 as first CI-built release)
- [x] Verify signed-MSI + NSIS-EXE build targets produce installers (v0.1.1 shipped both)

**Target:** tagged release with a working MSI and EXE installer.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Auto-update infrastructure

- [x] Ed25519 updater keypair generated (`~/.nanocrew-sync-updater.key`)
- [x] `tauri-plugin-updater` + `tauri-plugin-process` added to Cargo + package.json
- [x] Public key embedded in `tauri.conf.json`; updater endpoints set (GitHub Releases primary, `releases.nanocrew.dev` placeholder)
- [x] Updater + process permissions added to `capabilities/default.json`
- [x] Plugin wired in `lib.rs`
- [x] "Check for updates" button added to Settings → About with download progress + auto-relaunch
- [x] GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — builds signed MSI + NSIS EXE on tag push, generates `latest.json`, publishes to GitHub Release
- [x] `RELEASING.md` documents the release flow and key management
- [x] Upload `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` + `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` to GitHub secrets
- [x] First real end-to-end update test: tag v0.1.1, Actions published, "Check for updates" from v0.1.0 → v0.1.1 install + relaunch verified
- [x] Public asset hosting decided: GitHub Releases on a public repo (repo flipped public 2026-04-21)
- [x] CI hardening: MSVC dev env + NASM + forced `link.exe`/`cl.exe` on PATH + override of broken `CC_*` env var + WinFsp SDK install with `ADDLOCAL=ALL` + space→dot rename on artifacts so `latest.json` URL matches stored asset name

**Target:** every future change reaches our own machines via "Check for updates" — no manual MSI wrangling.

---

## Phase 1 — Correctness & UX polish

- [x] 1.1 Download progress on Transfers page
  - [x] Emit `transfer_progress` from `read()` on first qualifying read (file ≥ 256 KiB)
  - [x] Per-handle `DownloadState` byte counter, throttled to 250 ms progress events
  - [x] `close()` emits terminal `state: "done"` — partial reads treated as done (not error) to avoid flooding UI with phantom failures from Windows thumbnailers / AV / editor probes
  - [~] Idle sweeper deferred — not needed unless we see stuck rows in practice
- [x] 1.2 LIST cache TTL (5 s directory cache + 5 s meta cache) — already live; invalidated on every create/delete/rename/mkdir
- [x] 1.3 Verify small-file single-PUT path (≤ 16 MiB skips MPU) — gated on `upload_id.is_none()` at finalize; MPU only starts when contiguous writes cross `PART_TARGET`
- [x] 1.4 Strip verbose `[winfsp]` logging — keep errors, drop routine traces (stripped `finalize_write begin`, `cleanup flags=`, `upload complete`; all remaining eprintln! calls are error paths)
- [x] 1.5 Replace `tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread` drop-on-block pattern with a single long-lived runtime on the filesystem context — mount thread now builds one multi-thread runtime, uses it for AWS config load, and hands ownership to `S3Fs` for all subsequent IO

**Target:** every mount-to-Explorer action reports progress and stays responsive.

---

## Phase 2 — Provider breadth

- [x] 2.1 Generic `AddDriveS3Screen` — one form, presets for:
  - [x] AWS S3 (22 regions)
  - [x] Backblaze B2 (6 regions)
  - [x] Cloudflare R2 (custom endpoint flow for `<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`)
  - [x] MinIO (self-hosted, custom endpoint)
  - [x] IDrive e2 (8 regions)
  - [x] DigitalOcean Spaces (8 regions)
  - [x] Storj (global gateway)
  - [x] Scaleway Object Storage (3 regions)
  - [x] Contabo Object Storage (3 regions)
  - [x] Oracle Cloud Object Storage (custom endpoint flow)
  - [x] Linode Object Storage (9 regions)
  - [x] Vultr Object Storage (7 regions)
- [x] 2.2 Provider picker rewrite — single form at `/add-drive/<providerId>`; Wasabi kept as the recommended preset at the top
- [x] 2.3 Region/endpoint presets per provider — `S3_PROVIDER_PRESETS` in `packages/ui/src/s3-providers.ts` is the single source of truth
- [x] 2.4 "Test connection" button — already calls `list_objects_v2 max_keys=1` on the backend (HeadBucket-equivalent but also validates list permission); errors now prettified (AccessDenied/SignatureDoesNotMatch/NoSuchBucket/DNS/timeout → human-readable)

**Target:** any S3-compatible bucket mountable in ≤ 60 seconds from "Add drive" click.

---

## Phase 3 — Security features

- [x] 3.1 Cache encryption — every on-disk cache block is encrypted with AES-256-GCM (`aes-gcm` crate). Per-drive key = `SHA-256(machine_id || cache_key_salt || "drive-{id}")`; `cache_key_salt` is 32 random bytes generated on first use and persisted to the `prefs` table (so two installs on the same machine still produce different ciphertexts). Each block gets a fresh 12-byte random nonce, prepended to the ciphertext+tag on disk: `[nonce:12][ciphertext][tag:16]`. A failed GCM decrypt drops the row + file so the next read re-fetches — silent recovery from tampering, wrong key, or pre-encryption legacy blobs. Design note: we intentionally don't derive the key from the user password, because drives (and therefore cache reads) stay live through the Windows-lock flow — a password-derived key would break reads after lock. The machine-ID + install-salt combo still protects against "cache files copied off the laptop in isolation". 3 existing cache tests pass with encryption on.
- [x] 3.2 Credential-at-rest re-encryption — DPAPI-wrap S3 secrets in SQLite (`credentials.rs` + new `dpapi.rs`; `v1:<base64>` envelope with legacy-plaintext migration on first read; `add_drive` routes through `credentials::store` and never persists the raw secret)
- [x] 3.3 Session lock — "lock app on minimize" wired via Tauri `onResized` + `isMinimized`; `verify_password` backend command; `LockScreen` UI with password prompt; drives stay mounted throughout (files remain accessible in Explorer while locked); manual Lock button on Account screen; opt-in toggle in Settings → Security. PIN fallback deferred to a later polish pass.
- [x] 3.4 Audit log — the `activity` table (append-only) and `activity::record` helper already capture mount, unmount, add_drive, update_drive, delete_drive, account_created, sign_in, sign_out, password_changed. Added the missing lock/unlock path: new `record_lock_event(locked, reason)` command in `auth.rs` writes `auth/lock` and `auth/unlock` rows with the reason tag (`"minimize"` / `"manual"`). Frontend `App.tsx` calls it on both the minimize-triggered lock and the manual Lock button, plus on unlock via `handleUnlock`. Full security trail visible in Activity screen.

**Target:** "zero plaintext at rest" claim substantiated end-to-end.

---

## Phase 4 — File Lock (parity blocker vs RaiDrive)

- [x] 4.1 Honor Windows share modes in `open()` — WinFsp's kernel driver enforces share-modes natively within a single host; we layer a per-mount `local_writers` HashSet on top so a second writer-open on this machine fast-fails with `STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION` regardless of how it arrived. Writer access detected from `FILE_WRITE_DATA | FILE_APPEND_DATA | FILE_WRITE_EA | FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES | DELETE | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_ALL`.
- [x] 4.2 Lockfile detection — `file_lock::classify_lockfile` recognises Office `~$*.{docx,xlsx,pptx,doc,xls,ppt}`, LibreOffice `.~lock.*#`, vim `.*.swp`, and generic `*.lock`. VFS emits `file_lock_event` Tauri events on open/create/close with `state: "lockfile_created" | "lockfile_released"` so future UI can show "being edited" banners.
- [x] 4.3 Cross-device lock coordination — sentinel objects at `.nanocrew/locks/<sha256>.json` with schema-versioned JSON payload (`v`, `key`, `machine`, `owner`, `acquired_at`, `expires_at`). Writer-open checks sentinel, rejects foreign-machine holders with `STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION`, emits `sentinel_conflict` event. `machine_id` sourced from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid` (falls back to hostname). 15-minute TTL; heartbeat function present but unused pending a per-mount refresh task. Owner tagged from signed-in username (or `auto-mount` for startup mounts). Internal `.nanocrew/` keys bypass all lock checks to prevent self-deadlock.
- [x] 4.4 File Browser lock indicator — `commands/locks.rs` added with a `list_file_locks(drive_id)` Tauri command that enumerates `.nanocrew/locks/` in the drive's bucket, parses each sentinel JSON, filters out expired rows, and returns `FileLockEntry` rows (key, owner, machine, acquired/expires, `is_ours`). The File Browser fetches this map on drive change + refresh and renders a padlock icon next to each locked entry — red for foreign-machine locks, muted for our own; tooltip shows owner, machine prefix, and expiry time.
- [x] 4.5 "Break lock" admin action — `break_file_lock(drive_id, key)` command force-deletes the sentinel via `file_lock::release` and writes an audit row `mount/break_lock` with the acting user and the affected key (severity WARN). Frontend: a red "Break lock" item in the file context menu (only shown when a lock exists), gated by a `window.confirm` that names the lock holder.

**Target:** Office / LibreOffice / OpenOffice collaborative editing on a mounted drive works correctly across two machines.

---

## Phase 5 — Reliability plumbing

- [x] 5.1 Auto-mount on startup — `auto_mount_drives` in `lib.rs` reads `auto_mount = 1` rows from SQLite and spawns mount tasks in parallel during `tauri::Builder::setup`. Uses the `"auto-mount"` sentinel owner since no user has signed in yet.
- [x] 5.2 System tray icon — `TrayIconBuilder` in `lib.rs` with Show/Quit menu. Left-click toggles visibility; close-to-tray via `on_window_event` WindowEvent::CloseRequested → `api.prevent_close()` + `window.hide()`. Single-instance plugin refocuses instead of spawning twin tray icons.
- [x] 5.3 Start at Windows sign-in — new `commands::system::{get_autostart, set_autostart}` write to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` under value name `NanoCrewSync`. HKCU = no UAC. Settings → General "Launch at Windows sign-in" toggle wired via `AutostartRow`; includes `--hidden` arg so sign-in wakes to tray.
- [x] 5.4 Toast notifications — `tauri-plugin-notification` + `@tauri-apps/plugin-notification` wired. `useDriveNotifications(token)` hook at the AppShell level listens for `drive_status_changed` (mount / unmount / error transitions, skipping the initial status so we don't fire on load) and `transfer_progress` (upload success/fail). OS permission is requested lazily on first toast. Settings → Notifications exposes three real prefs: `notify_mount_events` (default on), `notify_errors` (default on), `notify_uploads` (default off — noisy). Drive names resolved from `list_drives` so toasts read "Wasabi bucket (Z:)" instead of "drive #3".
- [x] 5.5 Bandwidth throttle — new `throttle::RateLimiter` (async token bucket, credit-debit semantics so chunks larger than burst still work) wired into every S3 I/O boundary in `winfsp_vfs.rs`: `get_range` (download side), `upload_part` in the multipart dispatch loop, and `upload_single_put` for small files. `S3Fs` carries one `Arc<RateLimiter>` per direction; unlimited limiters short-circuit in `acquire`. New `prefs::get_rate_bps` parses MB/s pref strings (decimals + 0-means-unlimited) into bytes/sec. `MountConfig` gains `upload_rate_bps` / `download_rate_bps` fields, populated from prefs `upload_rate_mbps` / `download_rate_mbps` at both MountConfig build sites (manual mount + auto_mount_drives). Settings → Network → Bandwidth now has two real `PrefInput` fields; 3 unit tests cover unlimited / within-burst / proportional-wait. Per-drive overrides deferred — needs a drive-detail UI that doesn't exist yet.
- [x] 5.6 LRU local cache + pin — new `cache.rs` implements a per-drive on-disk range cache keyed by `sha256(object_key)` with 2-level directory fanout at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NanoCrew\Sync\cache\drive-<id>\`, indexed by `cache_entries` + `pinned_keys` SQLite tables (schema in `db.rs`). `S3Fs::get_range` decomposes reads into 1 MiB-aligned blocks: cache hits read from disk and bump `last_access`, misses fetch from S3 and write through. A background sweeper thread per mount (started in `DiskCache::start_eviction`) evicts oldest-first once `SUM(size_bytes)` exceeds the per-drive `cache_size_gb`; rows with matching `pinned_keys` are skipped via LEFT JOIN. New Tauri commands `pin_file` / `unpin_file` / `is_file_pinned` / `list_pinned_files` in `commands/cache.rs`. `FileBrowserScreen` gains a right-click context menu with "Keep on device" / "Unpin from device" plus a green-dot indicator on pinned rows. Settings → Cache & storage replaces the COMING SOON toggle with a real `cache_enabled` pref (default on). Caches are invalidated on upload success, delete, and rename so next reader sees fresh bytes. 3 unit tests cover round-trip, invalidate, and pin-survives-eviction.
- [x] 5.7 Reconnect on network blip — AWS SDK retry config bumped from default `Standard/3 attempts` to `adaptive/8 attempts` in `mounts.rs::spawn_mount`, so transient transport errors (Wi-Fi handoff, DNS hiccup, provider throttling) retry quietly instead of surfacing as Explorer "copy failed" dialogs.

**Target:** app behaves like a polished background utility — survives reboots, sleeps, Wi-Fi drops.

---

## Phase 6 — Activity & audit

- [x] 6.1 Persist activity log to SQLite `activity` table — new table with `id, ts, kind, action, severity, drive_id, actor, target, message` + ts DESC / kind indexes. Central `commands::activity::record(...)` helper wired into `auth::{create_admin, sign_in, sign_out, change_password}` and `drives::{add_drive, remove_drive, mount_drive, unmount_drive}` plus the `lib.rs::auto_mount_drives` success/error paths, so every user-visible domain event lands in the log. Inserts also fan out a live `activity_appended` Tauri event.
- [x] 6.2 Activity screen rewrite — `ActivityScreen` now loads from `list_activity` (kinds, severity, since, limit) and live-appends via `activity_appended`. UI adds KIND chips (ALL/MOUNT/DRIVE/AUTH/FILE/SYSTEM), an ERRORS-ONLY toggle with live count, free-text filter across action/actor/target/message, Clear log (`clear_activity`) and Export CSV (client-side Blob download, RFC-4180-safe). A matching Rust `export_activity_csv(path)` command is also registered for programmatic dumps.
- [x] 6.3 Error aggregation — client-side grouping by `(kind, action, target, message)` in the Activity screen, surfaced as an opt-in "GROUP REPEATS" toggle alongside "ERRORS ONLY". Each group shows occurrence count, first + latest timestamps, a Retry button for mount failures (invokes `mount_drive` with the stored `drive_id`), and a Dismiss button. Dismissals persist in `localStorage` under `nanocrew_activity_dismissed_v1` keyed by signature + ts, so new occurrences auto-revive the group.

**Target:** an admin can reconstruct exactly what happened on a drive in the last 30 days. (All three objectives now shipped.)

---

## Phase 7 — Settings depth (wire every "coming soon")

- [x] 7.1 General — startup at sign-in already done in Phase 5.3. Added `prefs` key/value SQLite table + `commands::prefs::{get_pref, set_pref, clear_pref}` commands and a `PrefToggle` UI helper. "Start minimized to system tray" now persists as pref `start_minimized` and is honored in `lib.rs` setup (window hidden before first paint if the pref or `--hidden` argv is set). "Check for updates automatically" persists as pref `auto_update_check` (default on).
- [x] 7.2 Drives — "Auto-mount on startup" and "Read-only by default" toggles now persist as prefs `default_auto_mount` / `default_readonly`; the AddDriveS3Screen pre-selects from these on mount so the "default for new drives" row actually changes new-drive behavior. Per-drive overrides still shown as placeholder card.
- [x] 7.3 Network — HTTPS proxy + custom CA certificate now fully wired. Added `aws-smithy-http-client` (rustls-ring) + `aws-smithy-runtime-api` + `url` crates. New `src-tauri/src/http_client.rs` module builds a `SharedHttpClient` from an optional proxy URL (with stripped + re-applied basic auth so credentials don't leak into tracing) and an optional extra PEM trust anchor, on top of rustls with OS-native roots and `SSL_CERT_FILE` honoured manually. `build_from_prefs(&db)` reads prefs `proxy_url` + `custom_ca_pem_path` and hands the resulting `SharedHttpClient` to `aws_config::ConfigLoader::http_client(...)` in all four AWS SDK call sites: `mounts::spawn_mount` (live mounts), `commands::drives::test_connection`, `list_drive_objects`, and `list_buckets`. Settings → Network replaces the Proxy & TLS placeholder with two real `PrefInput` text fields (debounced save-on-change). SOCKS5/bandwidth throttle still deferred to 5.5 — aws-smithy-http-client 1.1 only exposes HTTP/HTTPS proxies.
- [x] 7.4 Cache — Settings › Cache & storage now has a real "Cache location" card. Backend: `default_cache_root()` returns `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NanoCrew\Sync\cache`; `get_cache_root()` honors the `cache_root` pref when set (non-empty) and falls back to the default; new `get_cache_root_info` command returns `(effective, default, is_custom)`. `MountConfig` gains a `cache_root: PathBuf` that `spawn_mount` joins with `drive-<id>` for per-drive isolation; both `mount_drive` and `auto_mount_drives` resolve it once from prefs. Frontend: `CacheLocationCard` shows the effective path with a DEFAULT/CUSTOM badge, a `PrefInput` bound to `cache_root` (blank = default), and an "Open folder" button. Changes apply at next mount — existing cache data isn't migrated.
- [x] 7.5 Security — "Require password after Windows lock" now persists as pref `lock_on_session_lock` (replacing the COMING SOON row). Binding it to the actual `WTS_SESSION_LOCK`/sleep events is deferred; pref is in place for Phase 7.5a.
- [x] 7.6 Notifications — `useDriveNotifications` hook in `hooks/useDriveNotifications.ts` (wired once at AppShell level in `App.tsx`) bridges backend events to native Win10/11 toasts via `@tauri-apps/plugin-notification`. Listens to `drive_status_changed` (mount/unmount success + mount errors) and `transfer_progress` (upload done/error). Gated per-category by the existing `notify_mount_events` / `notify_errors` / `notify_uploads` prefs. OS permission resolved once per session and cached. Cached `list_drives` label map keeps toasts friendly ("Backup (Z:)" instead of "drive #3").
- [x] 7.7 Advanced verbose logging — `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` + `tracing-appender` wired in `logging.rs`; rolling daily file at `%APPDATA%\NanoCrew\Sync\logs\nanocrew-sync.log.YYYY-MM-DD`. Level gated by `verbose_logging` pref (info → debug). `WorkerGuard` lives in `AppState` so buffered writes flush on exit. Settings → Advanced exposes the toggle + "Open log folder" button. `eprintln!` calls in `auto_mount_drives` and `activity::record` migrated to structured `tracing::error!/warn!`.

**Target:** (partial) most General/Drives/Security rows are real; Network/Cache/Notifications/Advanced still show COMING SOON pending upstream work.

---

## Phase 8 — Internationalization

- [~] 8.1 `react-i18next` + `en.json` baseline — scaffold + four of the highest-traffic screens migrated: ActivityScreen, OnboardingScreen, SetupScreen, DashboardScreen. `en.json` now has ~90 keys covering tray, common buttons, activity, settings section headings, onboarding, setup, and the dashboard (incl. pluralised `subtitleOne/Other`, status labels, and error-hint fragments). `AddDriveS3Screen`, `AddDrivePickerScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, `AccountScreen`, `FileBrowserScreen`, `TransfersScreen`, `ErrorScreen`, and `LockScreen` still contain English literals — next wave.
- [ ] 8.2 Ship 6 languages (DE, FR, ES, PT-BR, JA) — deferred until 8.1 extraction is complete; adding locales before the en.json source is finalised just means churn.
- [ ] 8.3 Language picker in Settings → General — deferred (scaffold exposes `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` for the picker to consume once non-EN locales land).
- [ ] 8.4 GitHub-based contribution flow for community-translated locales — requires the locales/ directory structure to be stable first.
- [ ] 8.5 RTL layout smoke test — deferred until at least one RTL locale (AR/HE) is added.

**Target:** 6 languages at release; contributor path published for the rest. (Scaffold only; full extraction/translation is future work.)

---

## Phase 9 — Licensing & pricing gate

- [x] 9.1 License key format — RS256 JWT with `key_id`, `tier`, `seats`, `iat`, `exp`, `machine_limit`, `machine_fingerprint`, `email`. Verified offline against an embedded issuer pubkey (`license::ISSUER_PUBKEY_PEM`). **Ship-blocker for GA:** swap the placeholder PEM for the real production pubkey before 11.5.
- [x] 9.2 Activation flow — Settings → About → **License** card. Paste JWT into textarea, click Activate; `activate_license` verifies + persists to `prefs.license_jwt`. Deactivate clears it. Every activation/deactivation writes a `license/activate` or `license/deactivate` audit row.
- [x] 9.3 Machine fingerprint — `SHA-256("nanocrew-sync-v1|" || file_lock::machine_id())` where `machine_id` already reads `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid`. Chose MachineGuid over hardware UUID + MAC because MAC churns on NIC changes and the hardware UUID needs elevation on some SKUs. First 16 hex chars of the fingerprint shown on the About card so users can quote it to support.
- [x] 9.4 Tier enforcement — **soft launch**: backend computes `LicenseStatus { tier, is_pro, expires_at, days_remaining, ... }`; frontend renders tier badge + "Upgrade to Pro" CTA when `!is_pro`. Hard feature gates (max_drives, File Lock, cache encryption) deliberately **not** wired yet — see `license.rs` module docs for rationale (key-server hiccups shouldn't brick paying users). Adding gates later is a one-line `if !status.is_pro { return Err(...) }` at command entry points.
- [x] 9.5 14-day full-Pro trial — `prefs.install_at` recorded on first `get_license_status` call; `compute_status` returns `tier: "trial", is_pro: true` with day countdown until `install_at + 14 days`. Trial banner on the License card.
- [x] 9.6 In-app upgrade CTA — "Upgrade to Pro" NCBtn in the License card opens `https://nanocrew.dev/buy` via `open_path` (explorer.exe handles URLs). Placeholder URL — swap for the real Stripe/Lemon Squeezy checkout link once payment provider is locked in.

**Target:** a Free user can upgrade to Pro and see the gated features unlock in < 60 s.

### Follow-ups before GA

- Generate production RS256 issuer keypair; replace `license::ISSUER_PUBKEY_PEM` placeholder.
- Stand up signing service (Cloudflare Worker or Node CLI) that issues JWTs with the claims schema in `license::LicenseClaims`.
- Pick payment provider (Stripe / Lemon Squeezy / Paddle); swap `https://nanocrew.dev/buy` for the real checkout link.
- Decide whether to escalate "soft" tier enforcement to hard gates (max_drives, File Lock, cache encryption). Hook points are the `commands::*` entry functions — add `if !license::compute_status(&state.db).is_pro { return Err(...) }`.
- Decide offline grace period policy. Current behavior: JWT verified offline against embedded pubkey, so no network dependency — license works forever until `exp`. If a network-revoked list becomes necessary, add a periodic fetch + `revoked` check in `verify_jwt`.

---

## Phase 10 — Website + marketing

- [ ] 10.1 Landing page (Astro static site) — comparison table vs RaiDrive
- [ ] 10.2 Pricing page — 4 tiers, lifetime/annual toggle, FAQ
- [ ] 10.3 Docs site (MDX, searchable) — install, provider setup, troubleshooting
- [ ] 10.4 Release automation — GitHub Actions signs and publishes MSI + EXE to `releases.nanocrew.dev`
- [x] 10.5 Auto-updater — `tauri-plugin-updater` 2.10.1 wired in `lib.rs`; `tauri.conf.json.plugins.updater` has a minisign pubkey and two endpoints (GitHub Releases `latest.json` + `releases.nanocrew.dev/{{target}}/{{arch}}/{{current_version}}`), NSIS `installMode: passive`, `createUpdaterArtifacts: true`. Settings → About → `UpdateButton` calls `check()` + `downloadAndInstall()` + `relaunch()` with live progress UI. Ship-blocker for GA: publish a real `latest.json` and ensure CI signs updater bundles with the matching private key.

**Target:** a prospect can land on nanocrew.dev, pick a tier, check out, and install — unattended.

---

## Phase 11 — Beta → GA

- [ ] 11.1 EV code-signing certificate acquired; CI signs every MSI + EXE
- [ ] 11.2 Closed beta — 20 invited users, feedback channel in Discord
- [ ] 11.3 Crash reporting — Sentry for Rust + JS
- [ ] 11.4 Public beta
- [ ] 11.5 GA — launch-week pricing ($39 Personal for first 90 days)
- [ ] 11.6 Post-launch: Product Hunt, r/sysadmin, r/DataHoarder, Wasabi partner listing

**Target:** paying customers. Real ones, not friends.

---

## Deferred (post-GA)

- [ ] WebDAV backend
- [ ] SFTP backend
- [ ] Tailscale detection + bypass for LAN-adjacent buckets
- [ ] Local Disk Public/Private share exposure (SMB)
- [ ] macOS port (FUSE-T / macFUSE)
- [ ] Linux port (FUSE3)
